# RNN Models of Spatial Navigation Circuitry

Spring 2022 rotation work with Brinkman Lab, Stony Brook University

This repository contains a main program `train_model.py`, which trains a simple RNN model to perform a "dead reckoning" task, where it keeps track of an agent's current position using a sequence of velocity values as inputs.
