    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the code and notes from my rotation project in the Brinkman Lab from January to May 2022. The goal of this project was to attempt to replicate the results from multiple recent papers showing that RNNs trained to solve simple spatial navigation tasks can develop activity patterns similar to those of entorhinal cortex cells such as grid cells, border cells, and speed cells. While we were able to train RNN models to solve path integration tasks reasonably well, we did **not** observe any grid-like activity in the hidden units."
