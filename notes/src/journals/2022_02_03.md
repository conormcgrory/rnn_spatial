- DONE Create notebook showing environment simulation
- DONE Review Python 3.10 page (specifically pattern matching feature): https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html
- DONE Write movement simulator that reflects at boundary instead of resampling
- Animal motion simulation 
	- _Problem_: If variance of Brownian motion is too small, rejection sampling procedure used to enforce boundary takes forever (think about it: if all angles within three standard deviations lead the animal into the wall, then it will take more than 100 samples on average to get one that leads away)
	- _Software design question_: Does object-oriented methodology make sense here? Or should we just use functions?
