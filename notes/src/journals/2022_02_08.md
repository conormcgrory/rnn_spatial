- Met with Braden today 
    - Discussed problems determining mechanism Cueva and Wei use for simulating animal trajectories
	    - Braden suggested trying [run-and-tumble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-and-tumble_motion) models originally used for bacteria motion
	    - Found Python library for this: https://github.com/Deux9/runtumble
    - Asked question about "leak term" in RNN equation from paper
	    - Braden says this is totally standard in neuroscience literature, even though it's less common in  ML
    - Goals for week:
	    - Get network working on current simulated trajectories
