- Met with Braden 
	- Project at this point has two parts: replicating Cueva and Wei model, and using it to answer scientific questions about spatial navigation
	- Replicating Cueva and Wei Model
		- Figured out general structure of mini-batch approach
		- Need to learn about Hessian-free optimization and implement it
	- Scientific questions
		- Big one: How does RNN perform error correction during path integration?
		- Hardcastle et al.: Boundaries are used for error correction
		- Could this be true of "landmarks" in general?
		- Idea: Train network in environment with one boundary shape (e.g. square) and test in another (e.g. triangle)
		- Idea: Create network that takes landmark information as second input, see if cell responses are similar near boundaries and landmarks
- DONE Read Hessian-free optimization paper
