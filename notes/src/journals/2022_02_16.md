- DONE Install PyTorch in conda environment
	- Needed to create new conda env 'spatial-rnn' with python 3.9 to successfully install PyTorch. Once PyTorch supports 3.10, I can switch back to earlier env 'spatial_rnn'
- DONE Implement simple path integration network in PyTorch
	- Resources:

	- Simplified network has no noise or decay terms; otherwise is same as Cueva and Wei network
	- Wrote basic PyTorch code, need to debug
