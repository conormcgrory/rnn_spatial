- Meeting with Braden 
    - Explained that RNN is not training successfully on data
	- Talked about strategies for getting it to work
	- Need to do some research to see if path integration/dead reckoning is something people have trained RNNs to do previously (I'm assuming yes?)
	- Talked about ResNet (residual network architecture)
		- Need to see if PyTorch has a ResNet option
- DONE Try to get code working
	- Things to try
		- Make motion slower and straighter
		- Increase number of trials (need to check original paper for their numbers)
		- Change speed distribution to weight zero more heavily
		- Check to see if weights are blowing up
		- Check parameter initialization in RNN
		- Check to see if we can add leak term
		- Make sure there are bias components to input
	- Wrote scripts! Commit: `92a1399`
- DONE Research RNN path integration
	- Found one interesting Ganguli paper that replicates Cueva and Wei results: Sorscher et al., 2019
- DONE Write status report
