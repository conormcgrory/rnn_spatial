- Meeting w/Braden
    - Interesting observation about code: Forward pass equation seems to be missing factor of sqrt(dt); this hasn't caused issues because dt=1
	- Goal 1: Run Chris's code; make sure it works
		- Try zeroing out network noise (`bhneverlearn`)
		- If this doesn't affect result, then we can ignore it in our model
		- We want to SIMPLIFY!!!
	- Goal 2: Port over important features from Chris's code to ours
	    - Weight initialization
		- Look up: Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (also look at paper)
		- ResNet component
		- Add noise to input data
		- Add noise to network
	- Note: Good SDE book: [Van Kampen](http://fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/413/VanKampen.pdf)
