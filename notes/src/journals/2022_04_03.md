- DONE Figure out how RNN function works in PyTorch
	- Main obstacle: Need to understand how to implement `forward()` method for RNNs -- examples online don't make sense
- DONE Add weight initialization to PyTorch code
	- Orthogonal weight initialization is supported in PyTorch! (`torch.nn.init.orthogonal_`)
	- Sparse weight initialization also supported1 (`torch.nn.init.sparse`)
	- According to paper, initialization used for recurrent weights $W^{rec}$ doesn't affect results
		- However, they used different initializations for each environment: zero-mean Gaussian initialization for hexagonal environment, and **orthogonal initialization for square and triangular environments**
	- Bias and output weights $W^{out}$ were initialized to zero
	- According to paper, input weights $W^{in}$ were initialized as zero-mean Gaussians with variance 1/$N_{in}$
		- However, this **isn't** what they're doing in the code!
		- Need to read code and check commented-out lines to see what's going on here
		- Still haven't looked at this! Just using Gaussian initialization for now
	- Commit: `446553a`
- DONE Add noise to inputs in PyTorch code 
	- Checked code; turns out they aren't actually adding noise
	- Variable `noisamplitude_input` is set to zero, so no noise is added
- DONE Set trajectory parameters in PyTorch code to be equal to those from Chris's code
	- Number of timesteps (`numT` in their code, `N_STEPS` in ours): 450
	- Number of trials per epoch (`numtrain` in their code): 500
		- Code samples 500 trials for each "epoch"
		- This is the mini-batch that they use to compute the gradient and perform an update
		- They also sample test trials, but they don't seem to use these to perform update
	- Number of epochs (`numepoch` in their code): 1900
		- This is not the same as our idea of epochs
		- In their training routine, they only train on each batch once
	- Number of total trials(`N_TRIALS`): 500 * 1900 = 950000
	- Boundary is square with `x_min, y_min = -1` and `x_max, y_max = 1`
		- In our code, this is copied by setting `BOUNDARY_TYPE = 'square'` and `BOUNDARY_HEIGHT = 2.0`
	- Density of non-zero speed values (`density` in their code): 0.1
		- Speed values are sampled using `sprand()` function and then divided by 5
		- I'm assuming this is some sort of sparse uniform sampling function?
		- Full command: `speed = sprand(numtrials, numT, density)/5`
		- Need to figure out how to do this in our code
	- Angle is updated using commands (approximate):
		- `angularvelocity = randn() / 3`
		- `angle = angle(t-1) + angularvelocity`
		- In our code, this same operation is done by the `smp_direction_step()` method
		- Equivalent would be setting `std_brownian = 1/3`
		- This means that `np.sqrt(time_step) * std_norm` has to equal 1/3
	- Position is updated by adding speed to current coordinates
		- This is equivalent to setting `time_step = 1`
		- Therefore, `std_norm` has to be equal to 1/3
