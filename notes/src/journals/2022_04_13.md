- Downloaded RNN training run with learning rate set to 0.01 instead of 0.001. Didn't work very well; loss didn't decrease as much as previous run
- Found other codebases for grid cell simulation:
	- https://github.com/ganguli-lab/grid-pattern-formation
	- https://github.com/neuroailab/mec
	- Need to look at these to see what they're doing
- DONE Run MATLAB code from Chris
	- Code works, but is taking an extremely long time on my laptop
	- Need to figure out how to run it on cluster
		- Cluster has MATLAB
		- Need to replace plot commands with commands to save figures to file
- DONE Look at Python codebases for problem
	- Codebase 1: https://github.com/ganguli-lab/grid-pattern-formation
		- Written in PyTorch
		- One key difference: Hidden units are being initialized to zero
		- `batch_first` option in RNN isn't set to `True`
		- This doesn't make sense!
		- Another difference: Rayleigh distribution is used for velocity
	- Codebase 2: https://github.com/neuroailab/mec
		- More general framework from OpenAI
		- Uses TensorFlow
