# 2022-04-14

- Double-checked RNN code; weight initialization made no difference
- DONE Initialize hidden weights to zero
	- Added code for initializing hidden units
	- Added L2 regularization on all weights
	- Removed bias for input, recurrent and output weights
	- Started training network on cluster
	- Trained model still had biases -- not sure why. Might have been problem with git push/pull order. Trying again.
	- Downloaded model. Need to check if biases are still present.
	- Biases were removed for model (`test_2022_04_14.pt`), but performance was still bad. Going to try to increase speed density next.
