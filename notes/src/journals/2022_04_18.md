- DONE Run Ganguli code
	- Tried setting up locally -- didn't work. Code needs to be run with CUDA on cluster.
	- Need to create environment for code on cluster
	- Can currently run code via `main.py` script on command line
	- Should eventually figure out how to connect to Jupyter server running on cluster
	- Initial run failed -- `main.py` was trying to import `LSTM` from `model.py`
	- Second run failed -- `num_epochs` argument not recognized
	- Third run failed -- `Trainer` was looking for a missing file in `models` directory
	- This code does not seem up-to-date
